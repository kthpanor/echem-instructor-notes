# echem-instructor-notes
This is a repository for collecting Jupyter notebook exercises and fully worked out solutions associated with the echem book. From the set of exercises we select a subset for training events and schools. 
Name your exercises so that it is clear what they refer to and give a corresponding file name for the solution, e.g., scf-rothaan-hall.ipynb and scf-rothaan-hall-solution.ipynb.
