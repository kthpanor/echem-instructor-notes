## Exercises


### XPS

### XAS

1. Compute the C K-edge X-ray absorption spectra of the ethylene molecule using CVS-ADC(0), CVS-ADC(1), and CVS-ADC(2) in combination with the def2-SVP basis set. Choose an appropriate core space. What are the differences between the spectra computed at the different CVS-ADC levels? Are the differences between levels of theory larger in the case of core excitations or valence excitations? 

2. Assignment

3. Compute also the C K-edge XAS spectra of difluoroethylene, and trifluoroethylene at the CVS-ADC(2) level of theory. Compare the spectra of ethylene, vinylfluoride, difluoroethylene, and trifluoroethylene to each other. What are the effects of fluorine substitution on the C K-edge spectrum? How large are the chemical shifts?
